// write a function called contains() that accepts a linked list and a value. Return true if the value is in the linked list
STEPS:
[] find a marker
[] find some whiteboard space
[] write down a short problem description
[] draw a picture of the problem
[] write some pseudo-code // don't write a lot of code. Not as important.
[] write our solution
[] create a whiteboard challenges repo
[] take a picture upload it to your repo
[] submit it on canvas

## notes:
* No need to write the constructors but there is a need to agree on what the values will be called for the list items.
